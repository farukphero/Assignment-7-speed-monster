           </div>
           
          <div class="bg-primary mb-4 p-4 text-white">SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
          sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser,
          a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <h3 class="text-center p-4 bg-warning">2. Difference between global scope and block scope:</h3>
          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-primary mb-4 p-4 text-white">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the
          global object. <br>
          A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
          
          <br><br>
          Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible
          within that particular condition or loop.
          Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.

          </div>
          
          <div class="bg-primary mb-4 p-4 text-white">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
          Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
          an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
